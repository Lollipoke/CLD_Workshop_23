## Scenario

_when_

A user accesses the frontend

_then_

The backend receives a SessionID from AWS rekognition service and sends it to the client

_then_

The javascript FaceLivenessDetector component, that runs on the client, uses the client webcam and displays instructions to the user. During this process, it communicates with the Recognition Streaming Service that si running on AWS, using the SessionID.

_then_

The backend uses the SessionID to retrieve the result of the liveness detection from AWS. The result includes a liveliness score, and a picture appropriate to perform facial recognition.
